Capture the Flag
================

This program is a simulation of the game Capture the Flag. In this game, two teams compete for the ruling the world!

Each team has 3 flags. The goal of a team is to grab the flags of the other team and bring them back to its base. There are also special squares: foods and bombs. When a player walks on food, it gets duplicated, i.e. a player of the same team appears on this team's base. When a player walks on a bomb, he dies. Players can kill each other. If a player of team A walks on player of team B, he kills him.
